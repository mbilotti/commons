Hashtag aggregator demo

== Usage  ==

To bundle the app, drop your config file in hashtag_aggregator/conf, then:
$ ./pants goal clean-all bundle -- hashtag_aggregator --bundle-archive=zip

Please note that the first time you bundle or create the IntelliJ project, it may take a long time to download all the dependencies.

To open the project in IntelliJ:
$ ./pants goal clean-all idea -- tests/java/com/twitter/hashtag_aggregator:: --idea-project-name=hashtag_aggregator

To run the unit tests:
$ ./pants goal clean-all test tests/java/com/twitter/hashtag_aggregator::

To run using the streaming API:

$ cd dist/hashtag_aggregator-bundle
$ java -jar hashtag_aggregator.jar -http_port=8080 -config_file=conf/<your file>

To run using a local snapshot file:

$ cd dist/hashtag_aggregator-bundle
$ java -jar hashtag_aggregator.jar -http_port=8080 -replay_snapshot_file=<snapshot file>

To test the rest API, point your browser at:

  http://localhost:8080/api/model.json

You may notice that there's a ton of noise, near-duplicates, etc.
That's the part you need to figure out!

Additonal useful command-line switches:

  -tweet_log_interval=N : logs every Nth tweet consumed to the screen
  -snapshot_replay_tps=N : control speed of snapshot replay, in tweets per second

== Process Stats ==

To view the process' stats, go to http://localhost:8080/vars
Some interesting stats include:

  msg_queue_depth : number of tweets consumed from the stream (or snapshot) waiting to be processed
  tweets_consumed : total count of tweets consumed

== Static assets ==

The in-process HTTP server can serve static assets for you, for example: http://localhost:8080/public/static.txt
Files should be placed under src/resources/com/twitter/hashtag_aggregator/api (alongside static.txt)
See src/java/com/twitter/hashtag_aggregator/api/ApiModule.java for how to bind the resources to paths.

By default, the in-process HTTP server will also serve Bootstrap and JQuery for you, for example: http://localhost:8080/js/jquery.min.js
See src/java/com/twitter/common/webassets/bootstrap/BootstrapModule.java and
src/java/com/twitter/common/webassets/jquery/JQueryModule.java for more the complete list of paths.
See http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/ and http://api.jquery.com/ for useful documentation on these libraries.

== Config file format ==

A Java Properties file having the following keys:

consumerKey=
consumerSecret=
token=
secret=
